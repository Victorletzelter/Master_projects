# Master_projects
Some of the projects performed during my master.

Currently, the projects to be found in this repository are:

* Blind denoising with Random greedy pursuits: A project whose aim was to apply state-of-the-art time series denoising algorithms (SMP, SOMP, Blind Greedy Pursuit, Shrinkage), 
and test of their robustness with color noises applied on time series of electric consumption. Supervised by Laurent Oudre.
* Synthesis and edition of faces by GANs: Survey on real image inversion methods was performed. Boundaries manipulation using unsupervised methods,
and implementation of in-domain GANs inversion.
* Self supervised methods for low level vision: Application of supervised, and self-supervised image denoising methods (N2C, N2N and N2V) and comparison of theur performances.
* Reliable ABC model choice by random_forests:Overview on the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) Class of methods. Application in model selection using random forests.
